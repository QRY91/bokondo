                <h2>The Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Psychology studies, game design, callcenter work, bootcamp, startup burnout, back to school at 33. Not the typical CS path. But I've learned that caring about the craft—really caring about building things that work—matters more than the route you took to get here.
                </p>

                <div class="journey-phase">
                    <h3>Phase 1: Thrown In Deep (2020)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Months out of a C# bootcamp, I was solo dev on enterprise logistics for Maersk. API integrations with German customs systems, client relationships, project management—scope that usually requires a team. Learned fast because I had to.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="journey-phase">
                    <h3>Phase 2: Learning Through Friction (2021-2022)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Worked in environments where thoroughness was discouraged but quality was still expected. The classic double-bind. Instead of just moving on, I documented what worked and what didn't—patterns that now inform how I build things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Explored widely: cybersecurity fundamentals, game design, hardware configuration, Go, Rust, Python. Built real projects in each area. The goal was understanding how different domains think about problems—patterns that transfer across fields.

                    <p>
                        Built Panopticron during my BornDigital internship—a monitoring dashboard now running in production. Presented it as my graduate program capstone. Formalized what I'd already been doing in the field.

                        Monitoring dashboard that aggregates project health data from multiple sources into one view. Built during my BornDigital internship, now running in production. Worker-based sync, custom visualization components, real-time updates.

                    <p>
                        A game that teaches quantum mechanics through play. The dice behave according to actual quantum rules—superposition, entanglement, measurement collapse. Complex concepts become intuitive when you can interact with them.

                <h2>Technical Background</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Languages:</strong> JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, C. Some Rust exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Web:</strong> React, Next.js, Vercel, Supabase. Comfortable with the modern stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Other:</strong> Security fundamentals (coursework + practical labs), system design, local-first architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I document as I build—not for its own sake, but because writing things down forces clearer thinking. The notes become useful later when I need to explain decisions or onboard someone else.

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Why Engineering</h2>
                <p>
                    I care about the craft. Not just shipping features, but understanding why things work, building things that last, and leaving codebases better than I found them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The non-traditional path taught me something: difficult experiences sharpen your thinking if you let them. Every frustrating system I've worked with became a lesson in what not to build. That perspective is hard to get from a smooth career trajectory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for work where careful thinking is valued, where there's room to dig into problems properly, and where the goal is building things that actually work well—not just things that ship.
